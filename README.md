My name is Mizuhara37.
Programming is one of my hobbies. I think it can not only relax me, but also improve my thinking. I was OIer before the eighth grade. I like to do some interesting things. For example, Bright Studio, which I set up with my deskmate, iterated several versions of Bright Launcher and built the Bright official website.
One of my favorite words comes from the unlimited progress of the Up master "Mediastorm" in Bili Bili. I feel that I am making continuous progress. I started out as a pure C++console program, and now I am skilled in using HTML as an image program. Contrail Online, which I am currently developing, is the largest project in history in my opinion. It was completed by me alone. If you are interested, you can have a look at it. You can enter Contrail Team ---- it is also a team I created.

## üòê But I'm still wondering...

```rust
struct AboutMe;

impl AboutMe {
    const READING_BOOK: &'static str = "The book of life";
    const CURRENT_DEGREE: &'static str = "Master";
    const WANT_TO_UNDERSTAND: &'static str = "WHY we should HOW to do WHAT";
}

trait OpenSource {
    const CONTRIBUTOR_OF: &'static [&'static str] = &["Nope"];
}

impl OpenSource for AboutMe {}
```
